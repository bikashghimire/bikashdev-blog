# About Me

Hi there! I'm Bikash, a passionate front-end developer specializing in design systems and UI components. Welcome to my blog, where I share my insights and experiences in the world of web development and beyond.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Information Technology and am currently pursuing a master's degree in IT, with a focus on software engineering. My journey in the tech world has been both challenging and rewarding, and I've found a true passion in writing and sharing knowledge with others.

On this blog, you'll find a variety of content, including tutorials, tips, and best practices for front-end development, especially in creating and managing design systems. I also delve into topics like AI and Azure OpenAI services, areas that I find incredibly exciting and full of potential.

When I'm not coding or writing, you can find me exploring the latest trends in artificial intelligence, experimenting with new technologies, or simply enjoying a good tech podcast.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bikashghimire/) or subscribe to my newsletter for the latest updates. I'd love to hear from you, so don't hesitate to leave a comment or send me a message!
